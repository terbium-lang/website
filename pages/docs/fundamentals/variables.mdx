# Variables

Variables associate a name with a value. Use the `let{:tb}` keyword to declare a variable:

```tb
let x = 1;
```

The code above associates the name `x` with the value `1`. Notice the name of the variable `x`
is on the left-hand side of the `=` sign. `x` is an *identifier*, which is a name that can be used
to refer to items. The value of the variable is on the right-hand side of the `=` sign. In this
case, the value is `1{:tb}`. Since variable declarations are *statements*, they must terminate
with a semicolon.

We can then use the name `x` to refer to the value `1{:tb}`:

```tb
// x + x is 1 + 1 which is 2
assert_eq(x + x, 2);
```

  **What's an identifier?**

  ## Identifiers

  An identifier is a name that can be used to refer to items. Only certain characters are allowed
  in identifiers. They must start with a letter or underscore, and then they can be followed by
  any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. Identifiers are case-sensitive, so `x` and `X`
  are different identifiers. Identifiers must also not be reserved keywords, which are words that
  have a special meaning in the language. For example, `let` is a reserved keyword, so it cannot
  be used as an identifier.

  Actually, identifiers can also contain characters from a subset of Unicode characters (including emojis),
  but this is not advised so we won't cover it here.

  Here are some examples of valid and invalid identifiers:

  ```tb
  // Valid identifiers
  x
  X
  name
  first_name
  firstName
  name2
  _name
  _0
  _

  // Invalid identifiers
  2name // cannot start with a number
  8ball
  first-name // cannot contain a dash
  first name // cannot contain a space
  else // cannot use reserved keywords
  ```

  ### Raw identifiers

  Sometimes you want to use a reserved keyword as an identifier. Or, you want to use a character
  that is not allowed in identifiers. In this case, you can use a *raw identifier*. A raw identifier
  is a restricted version of a string-literal that is surrounded by backticks. For example, the
  following code uses a raw identifier to declare a variable named `else`:

  ```tb
  let `else` = 1;
  ```

  Raw identifiers are generally not recommended, but they can be useful in some cases.

  ### Naming conventions for variables

  Variable names should be descriptive. For example, if you are storing a person's name, you should
  name the variable `name` or `person_name` instead of a single letter or abbreviation such as `n`.
  All variables should be named in `snake_case`, which means all lowercase letters with underscores
  separating words. For example, `first_name` is a good variable name, but `firstName` is not.

## Assignment

We can also change the value of a variable after it has been declared. This is called *assignment*.
To assign a new value to a variable, use the `=` operator:

```tb /mut/
let mut x = 1;
x = 2;

assert_eq(x, 2);
```

Variables are immutable by default in Terbium. When an immutable variable is declared, its value cannot be changed.
Immutability by default is a feature of Terbium that helps prevent bugs.

Notice that we used the `mut` keyword when declaring the variable. This explicitly marks the variable as mutable,
allowing us to change its value later. If we try to assign a new value to an immutable variable, we will get an error:

### Assignments as expressions

Assignments are expressions, which means they result in a value. The value of an assignment is the value
that was assigned. For example, the value of the expression `x = 2` is `2`. This means we can use assignments
in other expressions:

```tb /x = 2/ /x = 3/
let mut x = 1;
let y = x = 2;

// Both x and y are 2
assert_eq(x, 2);
assert_eq(y, 2);

assert_eq(1 + (x = 3), 4);
assert_eq(x, 3);
```

### Compound assignment operators

Terbium has a number of *compound assignment operators* that combine assignment with other operators.
For example, the `+=` operator adds a value to a variable and assigns the result back to the variable:

```tb
let mut x = 1;
x += 1;

assert_eq(x, 2);
```

`x = x + y{:tb}` has the same effect as `x += y{:tb}`.
The following table lists all of the compound assignment operators:

| Assignment operator | Equivalent operator |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `+=`                | `+`                 |
| `-=`                | `-`                 |
| `*=`                | `*`                 |
| `**=`               | `**`                |
| `/=`                | `/`                 |
| `%=`                | `%`                 |
| `&=`                | `&`                 |
| `\|=`               | `\|`                |
| `^=`                | `^`                 |
| `<<=`               | `<<`                |
| `>>=`               | `>>`                |
| `\|\|=`             | `\|\|`              |
| `&&=`               | `&&`                |

## Shadowing

We can also declare a new variable with the same name as an existing variable. This is called *shadowing*.
We can shadow a variable by using the same variableâ€™s name and repeating the use of `let{:tb}`:

```tb
let x = 1;
let x = "hello";

assert_eq(x, "hello");
```

The code above compiles. Shadowing is different from a mutable variable because a compile-time error occurs
if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without using the `let{:tb}` keyword.

By using `let{:tb}`, we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable be immutable
after those transformations have been completed.

### Type enforcement

Variables can hold values of different types, but once a variable is declared, its type cannot change.
Learn more about types in the [Data Types](/docs/fundamentals/types) section.

This means that shadowing is also useful when we want to change the type of a variable without changing its name.
As seen in the example above, we changed the type of `x` from an integer to a string. This is different from
mutability, which only allows us to change the value of a variable, not its type. A compile-time error occurs
if we try to change the type of a variable without using shadowing:

## Declaring vs Initializing

When we declare a variable using `let{:tb}`, we can optionally initialize it to a value. If we do not initialize it,
the variable will be considered *uninitialized* and the compiler will forbid you from using it until it is initialized.

What does it mean for a variable to be initialized? Well, when we wrote `let x = 1;{:tb}`, we provided a value `1{:tb}`
to be associated with the variable `x`. This is called *initializing* the variable {"\u2014"} providing it with an initial value.

However, we can also *declare* a variable, but not *initialize* it. This means that we are not providing it with an
initial value. This is useful when we want to declare a variable, but we do not yet know what value it will hold.
An uninitialized variable can be declared by using the `let{:tb}` keyword without a value:

```tb
let x;
```

Then, you can initialize it later by using assignment:

```tb
x = 1;
```

Notice that the `mut{:tb}` was not used when declaring `x`, even though we are assigning to it later. This is because
the compiler can guarantee that the user has not used `x` (it is impossible to do so without initializing it first),
so there is no need to enforce explicit mutability. The `mut{:tb}` keyword is only needed when we want to change the
value of an *already initialized* variable.

## Lexical Scope

Variables are *scoped* to the block in which they are declared. This means that a variable is only accessible
within the block in which it is declared. This is called *lexical scoping*.

```tb showLineNumbers filename="Inclusion of line 12 will cause this to not compile"
let x = 1;
let y = 2;
// Surround a block of code with curly braces to create a new scope
{
    let x = 3;
    let z = 4;
    assert_eq(x, 3); // refers to the x declared on line 5
    assert_eq(y, 2); // refers to the y declared on line 2
} // z goes out of scope here

assert_eq(x, 1); // refers to the x declared on line 1
assert_eq(z, 4); // error: z is not defined
```

## Constants

We can declare a *constant* variable by using the `const{:tb}` keyword instead of `let{:tb}`. Constants are similar
to variables in that they let us associate a name with that value.

Constants are declared using the `const{:tb}` keyword instead of `let{:tb}`:

```tb
const PI = 3.14;
```

Constants are useful for values that we know will never change, such as mathematical constants or configuration values.

So what's the difference? Why would you use a constant instead of a variable? Well, constants are different from
variables in that:

* *Constants are always immutable*, not just by default.
* *Constants are always initialized*.
* *Constants cannot be shadowed*.
* *Constants can be declared in any order*, as long as they are cyclic.
* *Constants are evaluated at compile-time*, so no runtime overhead is incurred by calculating the value.

That's right, constants are a *compile-time* construct. This means that the value of a constant must be known at
compile-time. This means that constants can only be initialized with *constant expressions*, which are a subset
of expressions that can be evaluated at compile-time, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.

Constants are restrictive in this way, but they are also more powerful. Because constants are evaluated at compile-time,
there is no runtime overhead for using them. This also means that constants can be used in places where variables cannot,
such as in *type declarations*.

### Aliases

Expression-aliases associate a name with an expression, however they are not evaluated but rather inlined at
compile-time. Defining an expression-alias is similar to defining a constant, with the `alias{:tb}` keyword:

```tb
alias PI = 3.14;
```

Expression-aliases are useful for reducing code duplication, and for giving names to complex expressions, however they
should only be used when a constant or immutable variable does not make sense to be used instead. Since aliases are not
evaluated, they do not have a type and are not checked for correctness.

Aliases are also *unhygenic*, meaning that they are not lexically scoped:

```tb
alias X_PLUS_Y = x + y;;

// in another scope...
{
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;
    assert_eq(X_PLUS_Y, 3);
}
```

This can lead to unexpected behavior, which is why aliases should be used sparingly.

### Syntax sugar

Syntax sugar is a term used to describe a syntax feature that *desugars*, or "expands" or is "rewritten" into another,
more verbose syntax.

When we use a constant, the compiler will *desugar* it into the value it represents. For example, when we compile the
following code:

```tb
const PI = 3.14;
const TAU = 2 * PI;

println(TAU);
```

The compiler will *desugar* the code into:

```tb
const PI = 3.14;
const TAU = 6.28; // evaluated 2 * 3.14 at compile-time

println(6.28); // replaced TAU with its value
```

And then compile the *desugared* code.

With the knowledge of what desugaring is, the difference between constants and aliases becomes clear. While constants
inline the evaluated value, aliases inline the expression itself. For example, when we compile the following code:

```tb
alias PI = 3.14;
alias TAU = 2 * PI;

println(TAU);
```

The compiler will *desugar* the code into:

```tb
alias PI = 3.14;
alias TAU = 2 * 3.14; // inlined 3.14

println(2 * 3.14); // replaced TAU with its expression
```

It's also why aliases are unhygenic, because they are not evaluated and are inlined as-is.
