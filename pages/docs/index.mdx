# The Terbium Programming Language

Welcome to the official Terbium documentation! This documentation is designed to introduce and guide you through
writing code in the *Terbium programming language*.

## Why use Terbium?

Terbium is a *"high-level language that doesn't compromise in performance"*. It enables developers to write robust code
that runs at native performance speeds, while still being easy and quick to write, read, and maintain.

Terbium is designed to be:

* **Concise**. Write less code wherever possible. High-level constructs and language features make Terbium elegant to write.
* **Readable**. Being explicit and unambiguous in the code where needed while still being concise.
* **Simple**. Complexity is abstracted away from the developer when writing a Terbium program, but low-level features are still accessable whenever needed.
* **Performant**. With LLVM, Terbium can compile to optimized native machine code, so your high-level code won't compromise runtime performance.
* **Robust**. Write error-free code with Terbium. Null is a concept that does not exist in Terbium, and all errors must explicitly be handled. Mutability is explicit and memory is automatically freed.
* **Rapid**. Rapid-prototyping and developer experience is just as important as runtime performance. A *debug mode* compiles semi-optimized code that compiles fast and suppresses pedantic errors as warnings.
* **Typed**. A comprehensive type system allows Terbium to infer the types of most values and functions at compile-time. If a type cannot be inferred, it must be explicitly specified.

## Why does Terbium exist?

Terbium was created to solve a problem without the trade-offs of other languages.

If you wanted to write a program that runs *fast*, you would probably write it in a low-level language like C or C++.
However, these languages fail to be robust. They are prone to memory leaks, null pointer exceptions, and other
runtime errors. They are also verbose and difficult to read and write.

The Terbium compiler is made with *Rust*, which can run just as fast as C or C++, but is much more robust.
However, Rust introduces unique concepts such as borrow-checking, lifetimes, smart pointers, along with a strict
compiler, which can give it a steep learning curve and slow down development. Many also complain of Rust's slow
compile-time.

If you wanted to write a program *fast* (write/develop fast, not run fast), a language with a more lenient
compiler/runtime like Python would be a good choice. But these languages tend to be slow and easily introduce errors
and bugs at runtime.

Terbium is designed to be a language that is the best of all of these worlds. It is designed to be as fast as C or Rust,
as reliable and robust as Rust, and as flexible, easy, and quick to learn and write as Python.

## What is this documentation?

This documentation is designed to be a comprehensive guide to the Terbium language. It is not a step-by-step tutorial,
but rather a reference/manual for the language.

It should also be noted that both this documentation and Terbium itself are still in development, and as such, some
features may not be fully implemented yet, and some parts of the documentation may be incomplete or out-of-date.
