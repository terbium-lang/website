# Values and Expressions

All runtime "values" in Terbium are represented as *expressions*. An expression is
a syntactic construct, and it is a piece of code that can be evaluated to produce
a value. For example, the expression `1 + 2{:tb}` evaluates to the value `3{:tb}`.

There are many different kinds of expressions in Terbium, some including,

* *literals*, such as `1{:tb}` and `"hello"{:tb}`. These are expressions that
  evaluate to themselves.
* *variables*, such as `x{:tb}` and `y{:tb}`. These are expressions that evaluate
  to the value bound to the variable.
* *operators*, such as `1 + 2{:tb}` and `-3{:tb}`. These are expressions that
  evaluate to the result of applying the operator to the operands.
* *groups*, such as `(1 + 2){:tb}` and `-(3){:tb}`. These are expressions that
  evaluate to the value of the expression inside the group, and are used to
  control the order of evaluation.

We will take a closer look at each of these kinds of expressions.

## Literals

A *literal* is an expression that evaluates to itself. For example, the expression
`1{:tb}` evaluates to the value `1{:tb}`, and the expression `"hello"{:tb}` evaluates
to the value `"hello"{:tb}`.

Literals take many forms:

* *integer literals*, such as `1{:tb}` and `2{:tb}`.
* *floating-point literals*, such as `1.0{:tb}` and `2.0{:tb}`.
* *character literals*, such as `c'a'{:tb}`.
* *string literals*, such as `"hello"{:tb}` and `"world"{:tb}`.
* *boolean literals*, such as `true{:tb}` and `false{:tb}`.
* *void*, the unit value, evaluating to `void{:tb}`. This is the value of an
  expression that does not evaluate to anything.

### Integer literals

An *integer literal* can be written as a sequence of digits, optionally suffixed
with `u` to indicate that the integer is *unsigned*. We will see more about
unsigned integers later.

Optionally, an integer literal can be prefixed with *radix modifiers*:

* `0b` or `0B` for binary,
* `0o` or `0O` for octal, and
* `0x` or `0X` for hexadecimal.

For example, `0b101{:tb}` is the same as `5{:tb}`, and `0xff{:tb}` is the same as
`255{:tb}`.

Additionally, underscores may be used to separate digits in an integer literal,
for example, `1_000_000{:tb}` is the same as `1000000{:tb}`.

### Floating-point literals

A *floating-point literal* evaluates to a floating-point number. A floating-point
number is a number with a fractional part, such as `1.5{:tb}` or `3.14{:tb}`.

A floating-point literal can have underscores to separate digits, for example,
`1_000.000_001{:tb}` is the same as `1000.000001{:tb}`.

You can also use `e` or `E` to indicate scientific notation, for example,
`1e6{:tb}` is the same as `1000000{:tb}`, and `1.5e-3{:tb}` is the same as
`0.0015{:tb}`.

### Character literals

A *character literal* evaluates to a character. A character literal is written
as a one-character string prefixed with `c`, for example `c'A'{:tb}` or `c'\n'{:tb}`.

We will see more about characters later.

### String literals

A *string literal* evaluates to a string. A string literal is written as a
sequence of characters surrounded by single or double quotes, for example `"hello"{:tb}`

Strings can span multiple lines:

```tb
"this string
spans multiple lines"
```

#### Escape sequences

Strings can also contain escape sequences:

| Sequence          | Description                           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `\n`              | Newline                               |
| `\r`              | Carriage Return                       |
| `\t`              | Tab                                   |
| `\b`              | Backspace                             |
| `\f`              | Form Feed                             |
| `\\`              | Literal backslash                     |
| `\'`              | Literal `'`                           |
| `\"`              | Literal `"`                           |
| `\0` \[1]         | Null byte                             |
| `\x12` \[2]       | Character by hex codepoint (2 digits) |
| `\u1234` \[2]     | Character by hex codepoint (4 digits) |
| `\U12345678` \[2] | Character by hex codepoint (8 digits) |

\[1] Because strings will **always** have an encoding, null-bytes can only be placed in byte-string literals. \
\[2] Numbers are a placeholder of a valid hex value of the specified length, e.g. `\u200b`

```tb
'Here\'s a contraction with apostrophes'
"This is a \"quote\" with quotation marks"
'This string has\nnewlines'
'An em dash: \u2014'
```

#### Raw strings

Strings can also be *raw*, which means that escape sequences are not interpreted.
A raw string is written as a string prefixed with `~`, for example `~"hello \n world"{:tb}`
is the same as `"hello \\n world"{:tb}`.

#### Quote-escaped strings

A cleaner way to escape quotes is to use quote-escaped strings. A quote-escaped
string is written by prefixing the string with any N number of pound symbols (`#`), and then
suffixing the string with the same number of pound symbols.

For example, `#"hello "world""#{:tb}` is the same as `"hello \"world\""{:tb}`,
and `###"hello #"world"#"###{:tb}` is the same as `"hello #\"world\""{:tb}`.

#### Interpolated strings

Strings can also be *interpolated*, which means that expressions can be evaluated
inside the string. An interpolated string is written as a string prefixed with
`$`, any then any interpolated expressions are surrounded by `{` and `}`.
Use `{{` and `}}` to escape the braces.

For example, `$"1 + 2 = {1 + 2}"{:tb}` is the same as `"1 + 2 = 3"{:tb}`. The internals
of string interpolation are explained later.

### Boolean literals

A *boolean literal* evaluates to a boolean value. A boolean represents a truth
value, and can be either `true{:tb}` or `false{:tb}`.

### Void

*Void* is the unit value, and is written as `void{:tb}`. Void is the value of an
expression that does not evaluate to anything, and it should not be commonly used.

## Operators and Arithmetic

An *operator* is an expression that evaluates to the result of applying the
operator to the operands. For example, `1 + 2{:tb}` evaluates to `3{:tb}`, and
`-3{:tb}` evaluates to `-3{:tb}`.

Operators can be *unary*, *binary*, or *ternary*.

### Unary operators

A *unary operator* is an operator that takes one operand. For example, `-3{:tb}`
is a unary operator, because it takes one operand, `3{:tb}`.

There are two types of unary operators: *prefix* and *postfix*. A *prefix* unary
operator is written before the operand, for example `-3{:tb}`. A *postfix* unary
operator is written after the operand. There are no postfix unary operators in
Terbium.

The following are the unary operators in Terbium:

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `-`      | Negation    |
| `!`      | Logical not |
| `~`      | Bitwise not |

### Binary operators

A *binary operator* is an operator that takes two operands. For example,
`1 + 2{:tb}` is a binary operator, because it takes two operands, `1{:tb}` and
`2{:tb}`. All binary operators in Terbium are *infix*, which means that they are
written between the operands.

The following are the binary operators in Terbium:

| Operator | Description              |
|----------|--------------------------|
| `+`      | Addition                 |
| `-`      | Subtraction              |
| `*`      | Multiplication           |
| `/`      | Division                 |
| `%`      | Modulo                   |
| `**`     | Exponentiation           |
| `&`      | Bitwise and              |
| `\|`     | Bitwise or               |
| `^`      | Bitwise xor              |
| `<<`     | Bitwise left shift       |
| `>>`     | Bitwise right shift      |
| `&&`     | Logical and              |
| `\|\|`   | Logical or               |
| `==`     | Equality                 |
| `!=`     | Inequality               |
| `<`      | Less than                |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    |
| `>`      | Greater than             |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |
| `..`     | Range                    |
| `..=`    | Inclusive range          |


There are also *keyword operators*, which are operators that are written as
keywords. The following are the keyword operators in Terbium:

| Operator  | Description   |
|-----------|---------------|
| `is{:tb}` | Type equality |
| `in{:tb}` | Contains      |
| `to{:tb}` | Type-cast     |

### Ternary operators

A *ternary operator* is an operator that takes three operands. The *ternary if*
or *inline if* operator is the only ternary operator in Terbium. It is written
as `if CONDITION then THEN_VALUE else ELSE_VALUE{:tb}`.

For example, `if 1 > 2 then "yes" else "no"{:tb}` evaluates to `"no"{:tb}`. Ternary operators desugar to standard
*if-statements*, which are explained in the [Control Flow](/docs/fundamentals/control) section.

## Grouping (Parentheses)

Similar in mathematics, parentheses can be used to group expressions so that they are
evaluated first. For example, `(1 + 2) * 3{:tb}` evaluates to `9{:tb}`.
