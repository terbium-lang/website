# Getting Started

Let's get started with Terbium. This page will help guide you through the process of installing, compiling, and running
your first program written in Terbium.

## Quickstart

<Steps>

### Install Terbium

<Callout type="warning">

Terbium is currently in early development and this installation process is subject to change.

</Callout>

Currently, pre-built binaries of Terbium can be downloaded through the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/terbium-lang/terbium/releases).

Find the latest release for your platform [(see below)](#which-binary-should-i-download) and download the binary.
Then, extract the binary to a directory in your `PATH` environment variable.

The rest of this documentation will expect that the binary is eventually renamed to `terbium` (or `terbium.exe` on Windows), so it is advised to do so now.

#### Which binary should I download?

* aarch-64-apple-darwin for Apple Silicon macOS devices,
* x86_64-apple-darwin for Intel-based macOS devices,
* x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe for Windows,
* and x86_64-unknown_linux_gnu for Linux.

#### Building from source

If you are unable to download a pre-built binary, you can build Terbium from source.

To build Terbium from source, you will need to install the Rust toolchain. You can do so by following the instructions
[here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

Once you have installed Rust, clone the Terbium repository and run the following command in the root of the repository:

```sh
$ cargo build --release
```

Depending on your device, this may take a while. Once the build is complete, you can find the compiled binary in
`target/release/terbium` (or `target/release/terbium.exe` on Windows). Follow the instructions above to add the binary
to your PATH.

### Verify Installation

To verify that Terbium is installed correctly, run the following command:

```sh
$ terbium --version
```

If Terbium is installed correctly, you should see output beginning with the following:

```
Terbium v0.x.x
```

If you see this output, Terbium is installed correctly and you can move on to the next step. Otherwise, retry
the installation process or get help in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FqtZ6akWpd).

### Write your first program

Create a new file named `main.tb` and open it in your favorite text editor. Then, write the following code:

```tb filename="main.tb"
func main() {
    println("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Compile your program

To compile your program, run the following command:

```sh
$ terbium compile main.tb
```

<Callout>

Make sure the current working directory is the same directory as the `main.tb` file.

</Callout>

  ### Run your program

Finally, run your program with the following command:

<Tabs items={['Windows', 'Unix (Mac/Linux)']}>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    $ ./main.exe
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    $ ./main
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If everything went correctly, you should see the following output:

```
Hello, world!
```

</Steps>

## What's going on?

Terbium is primarly an **ahead-of-time compiled language**. This means that Terbium programs are compiled (translated)
into native machine code before they are run. This is in contrast to languages like Python or JavaScript, which are
interpreted at runtime or just-in-time compiled.

This means that you have to compile your Terbium programs before you can run them. This is what the `terbium compile`
command did for us. It took our Terbium source code and compiled it into a native executable file, `terbium`
(`terbium.exe` on Windows). This executable file is what we ran to execute our program.

### What about the `main.tb` file?

The `main.tb` file is the source code for our program. It contains the instructions that the Terbium compiler used to
generate the `terbium` executable. The `main.tb` file is not needed to *run* the program,
but it is needed to *compile* the program. This means that:

* You can delete the `main.tb` file after compiling your program, and the executable will still work.
* You only have to distribute the compiled executable file, not the source code, to run your program on another computer.

<Callout type="warning">

When running any executable file on another computer, make sure that the computer is running on the same platform and
architecture as the computer that compiled the executable. For example, if you compile your program on Windows, you
cannot run it on a computer running macOS. If you compile your program for Intel processors, you cannot run it on a
computer running ARM.

We will discuss **cross-compilation** in a later section, which allows you to compile your program for a different
platform or architecture than the one you are currently using, solving this problem.

</Callout>

Let's take a closer look at the `main.tb` file:

```tb filename="main.tb" showLineNumbers
func main() {
    println("Hello, world!");
}
```

This is a Terbium **source file**. It contains the source code for our program. Let's break it down line-by-line:

<Tabs items={["Line 1", "Line 2"]}>

<Tab>
```tb filename="main.tb" showLineNumbers {1}
func main() {
    println("Hello, world!");
}
```

The first line of the file begins a **function declaration**. It declares a function named `main`. The `func{:tb}`
keyword declares a function, and the `main` is the name of the function.

A top-level `main` function is special in Terbium. It is the entry point of the program. This means that when you run
the program, the `main` function is "implicitly" executed.

#### Do I need a `main` function?

No. You can write top-level Terbium code without a `main` function. However, it is not advised to do so, especially if
you are writing a library or other code that is not meant to be run as a standalone program. The `main` function is:

* *only* executed when the program is run as a standalone program (binary), and
* *never* executed when used as an import from a module or package unless explicitly called (i.e. `main(){:tb}`).

However, top-level code will *always* be executed, even when imported from a module or package. This could lead to
unintended side-effects. Effectful code or code that creates *global mutable state* will emit a warning from the
compiler.

<Callout type="info">

Global mutable state is any data that can be modified by any part of the program. This includes global variables,
global constants, and global functions. Global mutable state is generally considered bad practice, and should be
avoided when possible because it can lead to unintended behavior through data-races.

</Callout>

```tb filename="main.tb" showLineNumbers {2}
func main() {
    println("Hello, world!");
}
```

The second line of the file begins a **function body**. It contains the instructions that are executed when the
function is called. The function body is delimited by curly braces (`{` and `}`).

On line 2, we see the `println` function being called. This function prints its argument and then a newline to the
standard output. In this case, the argument is the string `"Hello, world!"`.
